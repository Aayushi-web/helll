    <p>Dinacharya in Ayurveda refers to the daily activities people need to perform to stay healthy. It is a Sanskrit word that literally translates to 'activities of the day'. Our daily activities play an important role in our long-term health.
        Studies and research have shown that any new activity carried out judiciously for 21 days naturally becomes part of our routine. There are exceptions in following dinacharya according to one's needs and capability. Very young children, the old and people with diseases can desist from following this routine. Medical advice is necessary if you are under medication.
