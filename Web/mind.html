			<h2>Mind</h2>
			<img src="../Image/mind.jpg" alt="Mind Image">
			<p>Human Mind is the sum-total of various mental processes such as observing, knowing, thinking, reasoning, feeling, wishing, imagining, remembering, judging and others. It is not a separate object which has or possesses these mental processes. Mind is these mental processes. If we take away these mental processes. No mind is left, just as no chair is left if we take away its back, seat, arms and legs. Therefore, mind is another name for those mental processes and activities put together.

                Our Human mind grows just as our body grows. It becomes more complex with advancing years. In other words, our mental processes become richer and more complicated day by day. For example, there is a difference between thinking and reasoning of an adult and those of a child of three years.

      <h3>What is Meditation?</h3>
        

        <p>Meditation is a practice which involves trying to train your thoughts to stay in the present moment, because in the present moment there is true peace.  </p>
<br>
       <h3>Why we need to Meditate?</h3>

        <p > constant desire to be somewhere else (some other place or time) can produce a slowly growing sense of dissatisfaction with where we are here and now.  Furthermore, when we are not paying attention is the time when the mind gets up to ‘mischief’ in the form of worry and rumination which are at the very heart of anxiety and depression. Spending even a few minutes in meditation can restore your calm and inner peace. It teaches us how to use the mind in a different way and to focus on the things that are most useful and helpful in our lives thus helping us to live more consciously and fully.
